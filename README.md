# Pizza Sales Data Analysis (SQL Project)
This repository contains a complete SQL-based analysis of a fictional pizza sales dataset. The project explores various business questions related to revenue, order trends, customer behavior, and time-based sales patterns using structured query language (SQL).

## Objective
To demonstrate SQL proficiency by performing data analysis on a structured pizza sales database, simulating real-world business scenarios commonly encountered in the food and beverage industry.
